0:00 - student
Sorry, 2.45, but I'm definitely wrong.
0:02 - tutor
Sorry. Totally fine. I'm happy to add a little time with you.
0:06 - student
How are you? Good. How are you?
0:08 - tutor
I'm good. I figured out what the problem with my computer was last time.
0:12 - student
What was it?
0:13 - tutor
It has to do with my USB drive. So I figured out, so if it glitches again, all I have to do is just turn this camera off and use my laptop camera.
0:24 - student
Oh, great.
0:24 - tutor
Okay. So not a big deal. All right. So this time tomorrow, you'll hopefully be a very, very happy person.
0:37 - student
I hope I felt really, really sick last night and like this morning, but I went to the doctor again because I went yesterday and I got these like weird inhalers, which actually made my cough mentioned that to me. Yeah.
0:47 - tutor
It actually made me feel like more sick.
0:48 - student
So I got these steroids. So hopefully those will kick in.
0:53 - tutor
All right.
0:54 - student
Yeah.
0:55 - tutor
How are you feeling? How are you feeling right now?
0:57 - student
Like sickness wise?
0:59 - tutor
Thank you. Health, energy, everything.
1:02 - student
Good, good. Like, fine.
1:03 - tutor
And you're going to go to that workout class?
1:05 - student
Yeah. I missed my morning one because I felt so sick.
1:10 - tutor
Okay. Just listen to your body a You're going to be okay. I mean, thankfully, you're taking a test.
ACTION ITEM: Complete 1 Kaplan reading section on computer (30 min)
1:15 - student
You're not running a marathon. It's true.
1:19 - tutor
So, what's your plan after that for this evening?
1:23 - student
After my workout?
1:25 - tutor
After the workout class.
1:26 - student
I'm going to do a Kaplan reading section because I was going to this morning, but then I felt really sick because Grace wants me to get more adjusted to the reading on the computer, which I understand, so I'm just going to do one of those.
ACTION ITEM: Review math formulas and English document
It'll just be, like, 30 minutes. And then I'm going to go through, like, the document that I've been, like, adding on to, like, all the math formulas and everything, and, like, my English document as well, and just, like, go through all that.
ACTION ITEM: Review some scholarly unicorn probability questions
1:49 - tutor
I already noticed it started to glitch, so I'm just going to switch to this camera.
ACTION ITEM: Wake up at 6:00-6:15 AM for test ACTION ITEM: Leave house at 6:50 AM for test
1:53 - student
Okay. But, yeah, that's my plan. I might go through some more of the scholarly unicorn probability as well. see Okay. But I won't stay up late.
2:03 - tutor
Okay. Good. What time do you have to wake up tomorrow?
2:07 - student
I think I have to leave my house at like 6.50. So I'll probably wake up at like 6, 6.15.
ACTION ITEM: Charge computer for test tomorrow
2:15 - tutor
What are you going to lay out or prepare tonight so you don't have to think about it tomorrow?
2:21 - student
The clothes I'm going to wear and then, or maybe like my computer, I'll charge it. I think they gave me computers, but.
2:28 - tutor
You don't want to have to think about anything tomorrow morning other than taking the test. Yes. Imagine that, imagine a life where you wake up like in the movies where you have this concierge butler who just like all you have to do is get out of bed. Put your clothes on for you. You want it to be as close to that as possible. So your concierge butler, by the way, because that doesn't exist as far as I know in your life, it's you tonight.
ACTION ITEM: Lay out clothes, snacks, mints, gum, water, Gatorade, pencils, calculator for test tomorrow morning
You are your concierge butler for tomorrow morning.
2:57 - student
Okay.
2:58 - tutor
night's student. Lay out the clothes. If you want to bring snaps or mints, gum, water, Gatorade, whatever it is, make sure you have that all set up, prepared, pencils, whatever you need, okay, your calculator is charged.
3:14 - student
Oh, yeah, it is.
3:16 - tutor
Good. All right, now, let's talk about your experience taking this test. Did you understand my perspective that even though it felt hard and you got a lot wrong, you still got a 31? Yeah. Which you wouldn't necessarily be that disappointed with. I know you're just worried about doing worse than that, but it sounds like this was already not your best test.
3:40 - student
Yeah, was definitely not my best test. So that means- That's all like a number six wrong, which is like, oh God.
3:45 - tutor
So think about the distribution of how you might score on any given day, would you say that this was to the left of where you would normally score?
3:54 - student
Yeah, for this enhanced test that I've been doing, yes.
3:57 - tutor
So if this is a representation of you on- You're on less than average performance, and if you have just an average performance tomorrow, you'll be there better. So that should be encouraging.
4:10 - student
But now I'm wondering what the actual ones are going to be like. This was definitely significantly harder than the test one and two.
4:18 - tutor
But the curve was also adjusted according to that.
4:22 - student
That's fair, yeah. I don't even know if they have a curve for these ones though, because they're released, but no one's taken them really, right?
4:32 - tutor
Right. But I think… Oh, but it's a question they've had, so I guess they can figure out how many… I think so. I think so, yes. Right. Let's pull up. Let's go over the test first.
4:49 - student
Sound good? Mm-hmm. I uploaded the photos.
4:53 - tutor
I see it.
4:54 - student
And I uploaded one from Scholar Unicorn.
SCREEN SHARING: tutor started screen sharing
4:58 - tutor
I see that too. I see The Nintendo snips. This snips. Rather I'll share my screen with you. All right, so this was from MC04. Half an inch represents 12 miles. Yeah. you get 30?
5:38 - student
I think I did five times one-half, and then I got 2.5, so I did 2.5 times 12 is 30.
5:48 - tutor
I want you to think about it again.
5:51 - student
Okay. Oh, you did 12 divided by one-half is 24. And then 24, 120.
6:04 - tutor
I still think that's a really weird way to think about it.
6:07 - student
Well, I think of it like 12 divided by one half, and then it's 24, so then 24 times 5.
6:14 - tutor
Yeah, the way I think about it is half an inch is 12 miles, so then one inch is how many miles?
6:26 - student
24. 6:27 - tutor
Right.
6:28 - student
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 30 does not make sense in the slightest.
6:34 - tutor
It doesn't make any sense, but that's where you need to use a little bit of common sense and get the sanity check. And you can also set this up as a ratio. Can you help me out? How would you set this up as a ratio?
6:47 - student
One half to 12, and then one to 24.
6:51 - tutor
One half to 12 equals, well, we want an X in there, so where does the five go? And where does the X go?
7:00 - student
Okay. Equals 5 over x.
7:04 - tutor
Yeah.
7:06 - student
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
7:15 - tutor
These questions matter, so...
7:17 - student
Yeah, exactly.
7:20 - tutor
I think you made a little bit too...
7:22 - student
You made an assumption a little too quickly. Mm-hmm. I agree.
7:30 - tutor
All right. Let's move on. Next. What is number... 14? Right?
7:44 - student
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. I still don't understand how this is F and not J.
7:55 - tutor
All right. Dataset A consists of the eight... There's... Listed. Dataset B consists of the eight numbers in A and a ninth number that's greater than 90. How will the mean and the median of B compare to the mean and median of A?
8:11 - student
I know the mean of B will be greater, but if the number is greater than 90, it'll go right between 87 and 94. So the mean stays the same.
8:21 - tutor
I mean the median stays the same, right? So let's review median. It's a middle number, right? Yeah, but I think you don't understand how it works when it's even.
8:32 - student
Oh, it would be 81 for set A. Oh, it would be 82 for set B.
8:38 - tutor
Oh, yeah. Oops.
8:39 - student
The median is in here. Oh, yeah, yeah.
8:43 - tutor
Okay, student, you have eight data points. If I list them, where is the median? How far into the list if you have eight data points?
8:55 - student
The average of the two fours. Like the fourth numbers.
8:59 - tutor
Or four. The average of the 4th and the 5th, it's the 4.5th is the median.
9:05 - student
Okay.
9:06 - tutor
What if I had 20 data points?
9:08 - student
It would be the average of the 9th and 10th.
9:12 - tutor
So the formula, we've gone over this before, it's n plus 1 over 2 is the position of the median. You need to write this down. Imagine if you had 5 data points. Where's the median?
9:41 - student
Is that 7?
9:43 - tutor
Which position? Is that how it looks? The third place. Where does 3 come from? 5 plus 1 divided by 2.
9:50 - student
Oh yeah.
9:53 - tutor
That's how you can remember this.
9:55 - student
Okay, I wrote it down.
9:56 - tutor
Alright. Alright.
10:02 - student
That was...that was stupid.
10:05 - tutor
I have...here. I want you to practice this really quickly. Okay. I want you to try this problem.
11:24 - student
Are we averaging like the 8th and the 7th spot?
11:34 - tutor
Tell me how are you thinking about this, student?
11:56 - student
Oh, we just average them all out? Wait, no, sorry. Do we just do 4 plus 0 over 2? I guess 4 students own 8 pairs of shoes.
12:27 - tutor
I think you're misinterpreting how a histogram works. So the data points here are how many pairs of shoes each student owns, right?
12:37 - student
Yeah.
12:38 - tutor
So how many students own 3 pairs of shoes?
12:42 - student
3. 12:43 - tutor
So that means our data set has 3 3's.
12:46 - student
How many 4's? Oh, 4 4's.
12:49 - tutor
4 4's.
12:50 - student
How many 5's? 2 5's.
12:53 - tutor
1 6. 5's. That's how a histogram works.
12:56 - student
Oh. I don't think I've seen... One of these before?
13:02 - tutor
Definitely Hath. These are pretty cow. I'd be surprised if you haven't.
13:08 - student
I don't know if I have. Because he's right as well out.
13:15 - tutor
I need you to answer the question.
14:00 - student
Eight?
14:10 - tutor
Eight. This is similar to something like this.
14:22 - student
Oh, yeah.
14:23 - tutor
So this is the same thing, it's just the data is represented differently. Remember STEM and LEAF here, they also asked for a meeting.
14:36 - student
This is kind of similar too.
14:41 - tutor
I'm really glad we went over this. Let's try another.
18:09 - student
Yeah, don't know, because I just, I, doesn't X have to be four, because, yes, so X is four, then I'm trying to figure out which number would go in for Y to be equal to, I'm, like, dividing all the answer choices by four, but then I'm trying to, like, find, I'm trying to, are you, why are you dividing them by four?
18:28 - tutor
Because. Oh, you're dividing by four to see what Y is, yes, okay.
18:31 - student
Yeah, so I'm trying to test all them, I'm doing, like, two plus six plus four plus one plus four plus four divided by six.
18:40 - tutor
One of them will work.
18:41 - student
And seven divided by two is 3.5. Okay, two plus six plus four plus one plus four plus five divided by six. No? All Y. Isn't it true? Was it true? X Arquine it true? You're None of worked.
19:26 - tutor
Okay. You tried. So J should work.
19:40 - student
Oh. Yeah.
19:43 - tutor
What's happening, right? This is not the first time we're seeing this. I think it happened on Wednesday, where you're just not using your calculator correctly.
19:56 - student
I don't understand. I did 2 plus 6 plus... 4 plus 1 plus 4 plus 7 divided by 4 equals 6, and then it gave me 6.
20:07 - tutor
Show me.
20:12 - student
Wait, I'll highlight it. The one highlighted.
20:22 - tutor
4, 4. Because you divided by 4, student. why.
ACTION ITEM: When using calculator during test, write down equations/problems to refer back to
20:28 - student
Oh, there we go, yeah. Yeah.
20:33 - tutor
Right, so these are the kinds of things like the calculator does not lie.
20:38 - student
You are making the mistakes, not the calculator.
20:41 - tutor
And I know you always think it's the calculator, but it's you and you need to own that because I don't want you to miss problems because you're hitting the wrong buttons. So what I think you need to do is whatever you're going to type in, I know it's a little more time consuming, but this has happened a lot. It's a common theme. You need to write something down like 2 plus 6 plus 4 plus 1 plus 4 plus y divided by 6 should equal 4. Just writing that down doesn't take that long. Then you have that to refer back to every time you're looking at your calculator. And in fact, you can just solve this equation directly for y.
21:22 - student
Yeah, yeah.
21:24 - tutor
So I think one actionable item for you that we're extracting from today is in order to not make mistakes on your calculator, you might want to just quickly jot something down. So you have in your visual line of sight, a reference for what you are typing into your calculator. Because otherwise you're trying to remember too much.
21:45 - student
Okay.
21:48 - tutor
Or you need to slow down. Divided by. Ask yourself what you're supposed to divide by.
21:53 - student
Mm-hmm.
21:56 - tutor
All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. These, those are really good practice. I have a couple more in here, but for the sake of time, I want to move on. If you want to do a little bit more later, these would be good prompts. So they're right there in the section that says follow up. All right. 17. think you could explain. The ordered pairs in which the following tables belong to a linear function. Which one?
22:38 - student
Oh yeah. Cause that's as like X increases, Y decreases. That makes sense.
22:46 - tutor
Is D linear?
22:49 - student
00112439? Yeah. No, that does not make sense.
22:52 - tutor
Yeah. The gap, one, three, the gap's changing.
22:57 - student
This is X squared. Mm-hmm.
23:00 - tutor
That's not linear at all. Here's the gap. We're going up by one, one, one. So it's plus one, plus one, plus one, minus one, minus one, minus one.
23:10 - student
That's linear. Makes sense. Yeah. Oops.
23:14 - tutor
Oops. All right. So I see your work on the side here. Your work feels incomplete to me. I want you to try this one again. You're missing something really important. You didn't interpret something correctly. So I want you to just read the problem again.
25:27 - student
Hmm?
25:27 - tutor
Have you noticed anything yet?
25:34 - student
That you didn't notice before? I don't have to, like, square root the foot squared, do I?
25:43 - tutor
No.
25:44 - student
No.
25:45 - tutor
So what's the formula? What's our formula for force?
25:48 - student
Force equals a.
25:50 - tutor
Oh, I didn't do v squared.
25:51 - student
Oops. Oh, that would make sense.
25:55 - tutor
Hmm. No. No. no. No. Happy next thing. You Seems like you just totally dropped the V square.
26:07 - student
Yeah, I totally did.
26:08 - tutor
How did that happen?
26:14 - student
Yeah, I don't know. Oh yeah, 400, there we go, okay. I don't know, I did write it down at least, but I just forgot to look back up.
26:30 - tutor
Okay, give me a remedy to that tomorrow, so that you don't make that mistake tomorrow.
26:36 - student
I think I just need to go quicker on the first, like the first couple problems, like on the math section, because at this point I was like, I was kind of like looking at the time being like, oh, it's running out.
26:46 - tutor
So I didn't really look back. Okay, so timing was a major constraint. Do you remember there being problems early on? Was it a focus issue? the problems, did they just feel hard? Why do you think you struggled so much?
27:01 - student
I don't know why this test is different than others. I feel like I've always spent a good amount of time with the first couple because I'm like, know I can get this right, you know? But I don't know. I wish I had a better answer than that, but...
27:19 - tutor
I think once you have a pretty high degree of certainty on a problem, you've got to move on.
27:25 - student
Yeah, I agree.
27:28 - tutor
Do you find yourself, like, you answer it and then you're rereading it and checking your work and doing all that before you move on? Not No? Okay. So maybe you're already going as fast as you can.
27:37 - student
I don't want you to risk... Yeah, because, like, the other math section doesn't have a problem with time, so...
27:42 - tutor
I mean, I'm always, like, battling it towards, like, the end, but, like... Yeah, but we also know those are harder problems.
27:48 - student
Yeah, exactly.
27:50 - tutor
Okay. All right. 35, so that was a reading comp.
27:55 - student
Yeah, 36, was just, like, I was just, like, figuring it out and then, like, something was not clicking. 134 one a No So I was like, okay, I'm like running out of time.
28:01 - tutor
I got to keep going. Do you want to try it again? Yeah, sure, sure.
28:05 - student
Something was just not working. think it was probably just my formula again. Oh, 58. 58? Yeah, I don't know why I found much trouble with that yesterday because that was not hard. Yeah. I don't know.
30:03 - tutor
Well, well done. You didn't let the inches versus feet throw you off because there was a unit change in the problem. Inches and these are all feet. Okay, you got it. You figured out the total volume was 104. That was the total volume, right? And then you just did that divided by 0.6. And you understand why it's divided by, right?
30:35 - student
Yeah.
30:36 - tutor
Okay. Well done. Okay, 37. Interesting circle.
30:45 - student
I remember this geometry rule that I thought it was something like 2x equals x. Like I know there isn't there like some sort of like with like the outside of like an angle or something or no. I was trying to remember.
30:58 - tutor
Yeah. It's a, it's a, that's. So I know maybe what you're thinking of, but it's really, really different from this, so this is actually just a Sokotila problem.
31:09 - student
Oh.
31:10 - tutor
Alright. First, I want you to find OA.
31:16 - student
Oh, you do? 12 times sign 20.
31:24 - tutor
12 times 20. Okay. Okay, and then find OP for me. Sorry, say again?
31:34 - student
It's 4.1, so then 12 squared.
31:37 - tutor
Hold on. Hold on one second. You said OA is 12 sign 20? Is that what you said? Did I hear you correctly? Yeah. That's not correct.
31:49 - student
So let's back up. I'm going to write it out.
31:51 - tutor
Yeah, you need to write everything out. Today is practice for tomorrow. Don't do things differently today than you do tomorrow.
32:08 - student
Oh, you have to do cos.
32:14 - tutor
So what did you set up? Cosine of 20 equals what? Definitely need to know our Sokitella for tomorrow.
32:25 - student
I know. Oh, Japan.
32:30 - tutor
my God. Oh, my God.
32:40 - student
Okay, 12. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. God. Oh, God. God. Oh, Okay, 12 times 10 and 20, there we go, equals adjacent. Wait.
33:19 - tutor
Raise what?
33:24 - student
Adjacent is opposite. Wait. Opposite is, yeah, yeah, tan, 12, tan, 20.
33:33 - tutor
Okay, great. Now find OP.
33:56 - student
12.8.
33:58 - tutor
12. And... How'd you get that?
34:01 - student
I did 4.3686 squared plus 12 squared.
34:05 - tutor
Oh, you did Pythag. Okay. That works. Or you could do cosine. Great. You now know OP and you know OA. That's enough to figure out BP.
35:00 - student
Oh wait, no. Why did I say that? It can't be 4.4 because it has to be greater than 6.4. It can't be 6.9.
35:18 - tutor
We know OP. We know OA. What's the relationship between OA and OB?
35:28 - student
They're 70 degrees.
35:31 - tutor
What is OA called? What do we have a name for the OA?
35:35 - student
Oh, they're equal.
35:38 - tutor
They're radii.
35:39 - student
Yes, all radii are equal. I was not thinking, yeah. Yeah, A point point.
35:53 - tutor
So it's OP minus OB. And OB is the same as OA. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Make more sense? Yeah, I was thinking. All right, 38?
36:19 - student
Yeah, I would normally plug in values for this. I just didn't have time to.
36:31 - tutor
Interesting. Try it again.
38:01 - student
Yeah, it makes sense why it's J. If I had more time, what I just did is I plugged in, I did an average of 10 values, and then I did an average of the eight values minus the smallest and biggest, and then I went through each, or I didn't need to because I know it's J, but I would go through each answer choice and see which gives us the average of them.
39:00 - tutor
So substituting values, totally fine approach, a little time-consuming, the underlying math here is important because this is one of their favorite tricks. We know how to find the mean of a data set. If you give all the data points, you add them up, you get the sum, and you divide by how many there are, right? But often we like to rearrange this equation. So it's mean times the number of data points equals the sum. Oftentimes problems will give you the average and how many you have. Whenever you see those, it's a good idea to multiply them together, and then you figure out what the sum of the data points are. Like if I had five data points that had an average of 11, then the sum of the data points has to be 55. So if the average of 10 scores is X, then the sum of those scores would be what?
39:54 - student
10X is the sum.
39:55 - tutor
10X. And the eight scores, what's the sum?
40:02 - student
8y.
40:05 - tutor
So therefore, what's the sum of the highest and lowest? Low plus high has to equal...
40:11 - student
Oh yeah, 10x minus 8y over 2.
40:14 - tutor
So then their average would be the low plus the high divided by 2.
40:21 - student
Oh yeah, that actually makes sense.
40:23 - tutor
But I know that's not obvious. It's just something you have to be aware of that they like... Testing you on this concept that the average times the number of data points equals itself.
40:35 - student
I almost guessed it.
40:37 - tutor
Almost guessed it. Okay, 39 is actually really easy with time.
40:45 - student
Yeah. How would you approach this? I know you just plug them all in.
40:49 - tutor
That's what I was trying to plug them all in.
40:50 - student
Yeah. But then it was like not working. Like I tried plugging them all in and something was not working.
40:55 - tutor
So once again, we need to get... I want to make sure you know what to do. We need to make Make sure that you have the calculator scale, so go for it, and let's make sure you're typing it in correctly, because if you're not typing it incorrectly, we need to figure out why.

Okay. Okay, four-thirds worked. Yeah, I think I'm doing something wrong, because four-thirds worked, but two is not working.

It was not working.
41:55 - student
Wait, oh, I see what I did wrong.
41:57 - tutor
What'd you do wrong?
41:58 - student
I just didn't swear it. Bye. We're on the other one. Oh, yeah, it worked.
42:04 - tutor
So at least some... I really want to have you crack this.
42:10 - student
I know.

42:45 - tutor
I think you need to have your eyes go back and forth.
